# So you wanna use my modpack, huh?

What you're going to need to do is first get the Prism Launcher. 
Once you have that set up, copy this link:
https://github.com/sh4rk-1e/pantheonmodpack/releases/download/prism_releases/pantheonmodpack.zip

##### or yknow download the zip and import it

Then, hit New Instance in Prism, go to Import, and paste that link there.

Happy Hexxing!
